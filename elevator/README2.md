# How to run application

- clone to machine
- type: `npm install` into command line
- type: `tsc -w` into command line
- type: `node build/elevator/main.js` into command line
- Elevator instructions are the same as the initial README
- to run tests: `npm run test` into command line

notes:

- you can change max floors by changing line 14 in elevator/main.ts -> right now it's set to 15
